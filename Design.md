# Shakespeare Game

As the character, the player will get put into the world of a Shakespeare play. The game will take place following the lore of a play. The game will consist of plays, chapters, and missions.

The loading screen will allow the player to select which play to enter. Then when selecting a play, it will allow the player to select which chapter to play. Chapters will unlock sequentially after completing each one.

The game will take place in a Bonelab (game) vibe, 3D environment, but in a medival, more peaceful setting. Each chapter will consist of doing a few quests/missions to complete the chapter. Sometimes these missions will align with the original text, like spreading lies about Antonio or disguising yourself to get an audience with a noble. But as the play goes on, the missions will become more entertaining, as in, "acquire the boom-stick" and "send forth thy fire". It will culminate in either ending the story in the way it was intended, or going crazy with the "acquired arms" and destroying everything.
